            <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Our Backstory</h1>
            <h2 style="font-weight: normal;"> FnF Fried Chicken and Fries is the culinary lovechild of two childhood friends, Vedant and Juvi. Growing up, they shared a deep bond over their shared passion for good food, especially the simple pleasure of crispy fried chicken and golden fries.</h2>

            <h2 style="font-weight: normal;"> Years later, after pursuing separate careers, the duo reunited with a shared dream: to bring their favorite food to the world. Thus, FnF was born, fueled by their cherished memories of picnics, family gatherings, and late-night snacking sessions.</h2>
            
            <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">After months of rigorous experimentation and taste testing, they cracked the code. FnF's secret blend of spices and a unique cooking process resulted in fried chicken with a crispy, flavorful crust and incredibly tender meat. Their hand-cut fries, seasoned to perfection, became the ideal companion to their golden chicken.</h2>
            
            <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">Today, FnF continues to flourish, serving up nostalgia and incredible flavors to a growing community of food enthusiasts. Our commitment to quality, exceptional service, and the magic of our founders' shared dream is what sets FnF apart.</h2>
